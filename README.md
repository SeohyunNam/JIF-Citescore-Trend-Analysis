# 📊 JIF & CiteScore Trend Analysis

This project visualizes the yearly trends of **CiteScore** and **Journal Impact Factor (JIF)** for major academic journals.  
Citation metrics were compared using data from **Scopus** and **Web of Science** for four representative journals.

## 🧪 Preprocessing Techniques Used

- **MinMax Scaler**  
  Scales features to a fixed range, typically between 0 and 1.

- **Standard Scaler**  
  Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance (Z-score normalization).

- **MaxAbs Scaler**  
  Scales each feature by its maximum absolute value; keeps zero-centered data and is useful for sparse data.

- **Robust Scaler**  
  Scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers (median and interquartile range).
